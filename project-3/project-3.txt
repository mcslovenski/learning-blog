For this third and final learning project I will be learning the Django framework for Python.
As a goal, I hope to make a functioning web application that uses Django for backend support.
To begin with, I started my making familiar with Django using Mozilla's instructional materials, located at the following URL: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django
While I began by using Mozilla's introduction and tutorial set, I'm still undecided whether I will continue to work thorugh Mozilla's tutorials or to utilize LinkedIn Learning.
This week I was able to gain an introductory sense of Django's capabilities and set up an environment to test Django in, next week I will try out some of the video resources on LinkedIn Learning.
In particular I plan on viewing "Learning Django" and "Building RESTful Web APIs with Django" next week and making some progress on building something deployable.

This past week the two main areas I spent time on were beginning the "Learning Django" video series and continuing to work through Mozilla's Django tutorial set.
I was glad to get started on that video series even if I did not begin applying any new concepts in a hands-on way.
I also felt that the Mozilla tutorials picked up and covered some more interesting aspects of the framework than they had covered in the tutorials that I completed the previous week.
This week the Mozilla tutorials covered all necessary basic concepts for data modeling and using Django's built-in ORM and for using and configuring Django's admin interface.
Next week I hope to complete the Mozilla tutorial set and perhaps watch a few more "Learning Django" videos on LinkedIn Learning.
